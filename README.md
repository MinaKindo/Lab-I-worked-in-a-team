# Team Contract

(Answer each of the following questions. Add anything you want at the bottom of
the section.)

**Is it acceptable for one or two team members to do more work than the others
in order to get the team an A?**

Answer: Although we prefer that all group members participate equally, the team will
collectively do what must be done in order to complete the project by the deadline.

**How will you use the in-class time?**

Example answer: We will spend most of our in-class time discussing work
assignment and keeping track of the progress.

Answer: We will spend time in class organizing our progress and making sure each
individual is up to date on their assigned work.

**How often will you meet outside of class?**

Answer: Once per week at the group's discretion, generally in the evening. Communication
will be continuous outside of class via Google Hangouts.

**How will work be divided among team members?**

Answer: Work will be assigned based on each individual's strength, after the work is divided.

**What will you do if one or more team members are not doing their share of the work?**

Example answer: We are aware of the difference in ability among the team
members. While picking the tasks (according to the answer for the above
question), some member can consider take less work. As long as everybody keeps
positive and constant communication with the whole team, changes can be
adopted. However, if a member cannot make the deadline and does not communicate
with the team, a majority vote can be held to determine whether and how much
partial grade the member should receive for the particular lab in progress. For
example, this member may only receive 75% of the grades the team get for this
lab.

Answer: Given the restricted schedule of our team, the consensus of our group 
is to simply maintain a positive attitude and do everything in his or her power 
to contribute equally to the team. If members do not make critical deadlines, 
we will decide collectively what level of credit said member should recieve.

(Such decisions must be reported to the instructor in written form. The member
receiving the penalty may switch to another team at the instructor's discretion
after the certain lab is finished.)


**How will you track who is responsible for which tasks and the work progress?**

Example answer: Using the following table

| Task | Assignee | Deadline | Progress (date) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scope and Stabilizer classes | John Doe | 10/11/18 | Scope done; Stabilizer 50% (10/09/18) |
| Hard copy | John Doe | 10/17/18 | Cannot print: code not finished |

Answer: Use gitLab and informal communication per issue.
