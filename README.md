# Team Contract

(Answer each of the following questions. Add anything you want at the bottom of
the section.)

**Is it acceptable for one or two team members to do more work than the others
in order to get the team an A?**

Answer:Do what you gotta do for the A.

**How will you use the in-class time?**

Example answer: We will spend most of our in-class time discussing work
assignment and keeping track of the progress.

**What will you do if one or more team members are not doing their share of the work?**

Answer: Shots.

(Such decisions must be reported to the instructor in written form. The member
receiving the penalty may switch to another team at the instructor's discretion
after the certain lab is finished.)


**How will you track who is responsible for which tasks and the work progress?**

Example answer: Using the following table

| Task | Assignee | Deadline | Progress (date) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scope and Stabilizer classes | John Doe | 10/11/18 | Scope done; Stabilizer 50% (10/09/18) |
| Hard copy | John Doe | 10/17/18 | Cannot print: code not finished |
